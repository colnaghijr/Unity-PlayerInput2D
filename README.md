# PlayerInput2D-Playground

Unity (at the moment of this project creation) ships with [Input Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html). As bizzare as it sounds, it is considered a legacy feature.

This project is a very quick, clean and to the point 2D project to learn and practice Unity's new [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.11/manual/index.html) package.
